# My Nand2Tetris Journey ðŸš€
[Coursera Official Page](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)

This repository documents my progress through the Nand2Tetris (From Nand to Tetris) course. It contains my solutions and projects for building a modern computer from the ground up, starting with a single NAND gate.
 
### The course is divided into two parts:

#### Part I: Hardware. Building the basic logic gates and culminating in a functional CPU and computer system named "Hack".
#### Part II: Software. Building the software hierarchy, including an assembler, a virtual machine, a high-level language called "Jack", a compiler for it, and a simple operating system.
